## Who am I?  

## I am Deyaan Priyani, a Freshmen at RHS. I am a tall, atheltic, some-what intelligent teenager. I love to program, play sports and videogames. I have created a couple games and cool/useful programs, using Java, Python and basic HTML. I play cricket a sport similar to baseball, I can both pitch and bat(Allrounder). I play for DCA, recently I had played in the following leagues: MLC Jr, CYCC, U14, U16 and CLNJ. This past summer I traveled to multiple states to play tournaments. I love to play Fortnite, a FFA gun game. I am not a "sweat!"
